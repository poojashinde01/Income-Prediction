# Income-Prediction
In this project I took  data from kaggle 
step1:- this is adults dataset by there gender where I use basic of statastics methods.
step2:- Exploratory data analysis
In exploratory data analysis I use differrent plots countplot,lineplot,distplot ,boxplot and pairplot.
cought which sector has most salary or which sector has people work the most.
step3:- Data Preprocessing:
check how many columns we will get after one hot encoding these variable and replace categorical variable using lable encoding
step 4: model selection
I use KNN algorithm train and test that model I get accuracy test acuuracy is 83% and train accuracy is 86%  which we can see model is overfitting,
 to solve overfitting issue I using validation split I got training accuarcy 85% and 83% testing accuracy
 again I use cross validation and hyper parameter tunning using grid search
step 4  : Decision use new model Decision tree
by using decision tree I got 82% accuracy 
step 5 : I use random forest algorithm:
where I got 84% accuracy
as my tar 2 classes Logistic regression will work best.
by siing logistic regression model it gives 79% accuracy.
